### Overview

This website itself is an ongoing conceptual artwork, exploring the boundaries between code and artistic creation. Each line of code is an artistic expression, each function an artistic statement. 
The website's logo, generated through AI, embodies this fusion of technology and aesthetics - a minimalist interpretation of an urban landscape contained within a perfect circle. 
When viewers interact with the website, they are not just browsing a digital gallery but participating in a dialogue about the nature of art. 
This is a living artwork whose lifecycle begins with deployment but never ends. It challenges the static nature of traditional art by creating an eternally evolving artistic space through code.

### Processing

There is a separate [repo](https://github.com/zttofficial/Interactive-Art-Processing) for interactive artwork done with Processing.
